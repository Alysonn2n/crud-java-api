## First Java API

Hey, how is it going? So, this is a simple CRUD api that i made using `maven` and `spring-boot`, with the help of
`freecodecamp` videos.

### Setup

First, you need to have docker installed on your computer, so check out docker website and see 
how to install it on your operation system (https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/).

Then, run on terminal:

``` docker-compose -f docker-compose-prod.yaml up -d ```

And simple as that, you have crud-api running.


### To-do

- [x] HTTP requests for task
- [x] Dockerize application
- [ ] Make an alternative for RowMapper implementation
- [ ] Create Useful JSON bodies for responses
- [ ] Create "statuses" as a new feature for tasks
